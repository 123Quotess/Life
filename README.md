# Life
.Finish each day and be done with it U did what U could some blunders and absurdities no doubt Kept in. Forget them as soon as U can 2morrow is a new day U will start serenely and with too high a spirit..To  be encumbered with ur old nonsense..I can never read all the books  what I want,I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want I can never train myself in all the skills I want and why I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of the physical and mental experience in my life. And I am horribly limited....
